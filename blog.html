                    </h2>
                    <p>When people try to learn JavaScript, or any coding skill really, they often run into the same challenges:</p>
                    <p>Some concepts can be confusing, especially if you’re coming from another language </p>
                    <p>It’s hard to find the time (and sometimes the motivation) to learn. </p>
                    <p>Once you’ve understood something, it’s all too easy to forget it again.</p>

                    <p>For many people looking to learn quickly when diving into JavaScript, one of the first questions they ask is which framework to use (and let’s be fair, there’s a lot). But if you haven’t gotten comfortable with raw JavaScript, this is the wrong question to be asking. You’ll spend all of your time researching different frameworks and none of your time actually moving forwards. </p>

                    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.
